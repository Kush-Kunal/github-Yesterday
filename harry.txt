As any true Harry Potter fan would know,
the Patronus of any person is its most powerful guide, 
protector and charm against some of the worst creatures, Dementors.
This Patronus is represented by some form of animal or creature native to the Wizarding World, 
and represents our innermost character traits, standing up for us when we need it most, 
and shouting “Expecto Patronum!”
