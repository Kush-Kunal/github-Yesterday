Who can cast the Patronus charm?
The Patronus is a form of advanced magic which even the most qualified wizards can struggle with.
Harry Potter was one of the youngest wizards to cast a corporeal Patronus, 
having been taught by Professor Lupin at the tender age of 13.

And, erm, what exactly is a Patronus?
As Professor Lupin told Harry in Prisoner of Azkaban, 
the Patronus is ‘a kind of Anti-Dementor – a guardian which acts as a shield between you and the Dementor.
It’s also a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds 
upon – hope, happiness, the desire to survive – but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can,
so the Dementors can’t hurt it.’

The Patronus has two forms, non-corporeal and corporeal.
A non-corporeal Patronus can appear as ‘a thin wisp of silver’ that hovers ‘like mist’. 
Whereas a corporeal Patronus has a form that is clearly defined and is more than vapour or smoke.

The ability to cast a corporeal or non-corporeal Patronus is down to the skill of the witch or wizard.
Each Patronus is unique to the witch or wizard who conjures it, and it’s possible, in some cases,
for a Patronus to change.
